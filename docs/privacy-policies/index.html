        The app uses various permissions and dependencies to provide its

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Camera and Photo Library:</strong> The app uses the camera and
          photo library for features such as profile image upload and video
          recording. We use <code>image_picker</code> and
          <code>image_cropper</code> for these purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage Access:</strong> The app requires access to storage
          for saving and retrieving user data and media files. Dependencies like
          <code>file_picker</code> assist with this.
        </li>
        <li>

          updates and important information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics:</strong> We collect usage data to improve the app
          experience using <code>firebase_analytics</code>.

        <li>
          <strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> We use

          for better stability.

        <li>
